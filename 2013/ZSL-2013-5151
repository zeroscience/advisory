Atlassian JIRA v6.0.3 Arbitrary HTML/Script Execution Vulnerability


Vendor: Atlassian Corporation Pty Ltd.
Product web page: https://www.atlassian.com
Affected version: 6.0.3 and 6.0.2

Summary: JIRA is an issue tracking project management software
for teams planning, building, and launching great products.

Desc: JIRA suffers from a reflected XSS issue due to a failure
to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the 'name' GET parameter
in the 'deleteuserconfirm.jsp' script. Attackers can exploit this
weakness to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser
session.

Vulnerable JSP script location:
- jira-components/jira-webapp/src/main/webapp/secure/admin/user/views/deleteuserconfirm.jsp


Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (EN)
