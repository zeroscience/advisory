Summary: Emby (formerly Media Browser) is a media server designed to organize,
play, and stream audio and video to a variety of devices. Emby is open-source,
and uses a client-server model. Two comparable media servers are Plex and Windows
Media Center.

Desc: Emby suffers from a XSS issue due to a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied
input to the URL path filename when handling 'not found' errors. Attackers can exploit
this weakness to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session.
