WampServer <= 2.2c (lang) Remote Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability


Vendor: Alter Way
Product web page: http://www.wampserver.com
Affected version: <= 2.2c (32/64bit)

Summary: WampServer is a Windows web development environment.
It allows you to create web applications with Apache2, PHP and
a MySQL database.

Desc: WampServer is vulnerable to cross-site scripting vulnerability.
This issue is due to the application's failure to properly sanitize
user-supplied input thru the 'lang' parameter (GET) in index.php script.
An attacker may leverage any of the cross-site scripting issues to have
arbitrary script code executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in
the context of the affected site. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based
authentication credentials, phishing as well as other attacks.
