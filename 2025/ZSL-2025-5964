Ilevia EVE X1/X5 Server 4.7.18.0.eden Insecure Hashing Algorithm


Vendor: Ilevia Srl.
Product web page: https://www.ilevia.com
Affected version: <= 4.7.18.0.eden (Logic ver: 6.00)

Summary: EVE is a smart home and building automation solution designed
for both residential and commercial environments, including malls, hotels,
restaurants, bars, gyms, spas, boardrooms, and offices. It enables comprehensive
control and monitoring of electrical installations through a highly customizable,
user-friendly interface.

EVE is a multi-protocol platform that integrates various systems within
a smart building to enhance comfort, security, safety, and energy efficiency.
Users can manage building functions via iPhone, iPad, Android devices, Windows
PCs, or Mac computers.

The EVE X1 Server is the dedicated hardware solution for advanced building
automation needs. Compact and powerful, it is ideal for apartments, small
to medium-sized homes, and smaller commercial installations. It is designed
to manage entire automation systems reliably and efficiently.

Desc: The application stores user passwords in the database using the MD5 hashing
algorithm, which is considered cryptographically insecure due to its vulnerability
to collision and brute-force attacks. MD5 lacks modern protections such as salting
and computational hardness, making it trivial for attackers to crack password hashes
using precomputed rainbow tables or GPU-accelerated dictionary attacks.

Tested on: GNU/Linux 5.4.35 (armv7l)
           GNU/Linux 4.19.97 (armv7l)
           Armbian 20.02.1 Buster
           Apache/2.4.38 (Debian)
           PHP Version 7.3.14
