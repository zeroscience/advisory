Summary: Sielco develops and produces radio links for all
transmission and reception needs, thanks to innovative units
and excellent performances, accompanied by a high reliability
and low consumption.

Desc: The Cookie session ID 'id' is of an insufficient length and
can be exploited by brute force, which may allow a remote attacker
to obtain a valid session, bypass authentication and manipulate
the transmitter.
