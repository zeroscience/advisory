Limny 3.0.1 (login.php) Remote URI Based Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability


Vendor: Hamidreza Samak
Product web page: http://www.limny.org
Affected version: 3.0.1

Summary: Limny is a free and open-source content management framework
with a focus on ease to use and develop. It can be used as a stable
and powerful core for heavy and light web applications by having main
features of web applications such as user management, multilingual system
and multiple theme support. Also its rich graphic library helps designers
to create colorable themes instead of designing multiple themes.

Desc: Limny suffers from a XSS issue in '/admin/login.php' that uses the
'PHP_SELF' variable. The vulnerability is present because there isn't any
filtering to the mentioned variable in the affected script. Attackers can
exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's
browser session.
