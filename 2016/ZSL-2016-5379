Orthanc DICOM Server 1.1.0 Unquoted Service Path Privilege Escalation


Vendor: Sébastien Jodogne
Product web page: http://www.orthanc-server.com
Affected version: 1.1.0

Summary: Orthanc is a Belgian, open-source, lightweight RESTful DICOM server
for healthcare and medical research with an ubiquitous web interface that
enables you to upload, receive and transfer DICOM images. It comes with
a REST API to automate imaging flows and an SDK to integrate with native
applications.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting the
service 'orthanc' for Windows deployed as part of Orthanc DICOM server solution.
This could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute
arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. A successful attempt would
require the local user to be able to insert their code in the system root path
undetected by the OS or other security applications where it could potentially be
executed during application startup or reboot. If successful, the local user’s code
would execute with the elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (EN)
