OctoberCMS v3.4.0 (Blog) Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities


Vendor: October CMS
Product web page: https://www.octobercms.com
Affected version: 3.4.0

Summary: OctoberCMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS)
based on the PHP programming language and Laravel web application framework.
It supports MySQL, SQLite and PostgreSQL for the database back end and
uses a flat file database for the front end structure. The October CMS
covers a range of capabilities such as users, permissions, themes, and
plugins, and is seen as a simpler alternative to WordPress.

Desc: OctoberCMS suffers from stored cross-site scripting vulnerability
when a user with the ability to a blog-creating feature that stores data
persistently could perform a stored XSS attack against any other users
visiting the blog page. This can lead to execute arbitrary HTML/JS code
in a user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Tested on: macOS Monterey 12.6.3
           Docker 4.12.0 (85629)
           PHP/8.1.6
