devolo dLAN Cockpit 4.3.1 Unquoted Service Path Privilege Escalation


Vendor: devolo AG
Product web page: https://www.devolo.com
Affected version: 4.3.1

Summary: devolo dLAN® Cockpit is a software tool that allows devolo
customers to monitor and optimise their dLAN® network using a software
tool.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue
impacting the service 'DevoloNetworkService' for Windows deployed
as part of Devolo dLAN® Cockpit software application. This could
potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to
execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. A
successful attempt would require the local user to be able to insert
their code in the system root path undetected by the OS or other
security applications where it could potentially be executed during
application startup or reboot. If successful, the local user's code
would execute with the elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (EN)
