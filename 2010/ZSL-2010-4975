 Native Instruments Service Center 2.2.5 Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability


 Vendor: Native Instruments GmbH
 Product web page: http://www.native-instruments.com
 Affected version: 2.2.5 (R596)

 Summary: The NI Service Center is a service used for Product Activation.

 Desc: The Service Center suffers from a DLL hijacking vulnerability, which could be
 exploited by remote attackers to compromise a vulnerable system. This issue is
 caused due to the application insecurely loading certain libraries ("schannel.dll")
 from the current working directory, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary
 code by tricking a user into opening an activation return file (.naf) from a network
 share.

 Tested on: Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 (English)
