# Daikin Security Gateway v214 Remote Password Reset
#
#
# Vendor: Daikin Industries, Ltd.
# Product web page: https://www.daikin.com
# https://www.daikin.eu/en_us/products/product.html/DRGATEWAYAA.html
# Affected version: App: 100, Frm: 214
#
# Summary: The Security gateway allows the iTM and LC8 controllers
# to connect through the Security gateway to the Daikin Cloud Service.
# Instead of sending the report to the router directly, the iTM or
# LC8 controller sends the report to the Security gateway first. The
# Security gateway transforms the report format from http to https
# and then sends the transformed https report to the Daikin Cloud
# Service via the router. Built-in LAN adapter enabling online control.
#
# Desc: The Daikin Security Gateway exposes a critical vulnerability
# in its password reset API endpoint. Due to an IDOR flaw, an unauthenticated
# attacker can send a crafted POST request to this endpoint, bypassing
# authentication mechanisms. Successful exploitation resets the system
# credentials to the default Daikin:Daikin username and password combination.
# This allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the system without
# prior credentials, potentially compromising connected devices and networks.

# Tested on: fasthttp
