OctoberCMS v3.4.0 (Author) Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability


Vendor: October CMS
Product web page: https://www.octobercms.com
Affected version: 3.4.0

Summary: OctoberCMS is a self-hosted content management system (CMS)
based on the PHP programming language and Laravel web application framework.
It supports MySQL, SQLite and PostgreSQL for the database back end and
uses a flat file database for the front end structure. The October CMS
covers a range of capabilities such as users, permissions, themes, and
plugins, and is seen as a simpler alternative to WordPress.

Desc: OctoberCMS suffers from stored cross-site scripting vulnerability
when a user with the ability to be an author feature could perform a stored
XSS attack against any other users visiting the posts by the author. This
can lead to execute arbitrary HTML/JS code in a user's browser session
in context of an affected site.

Tested on: macOS Monterey 12.6.3
           Docker 4.12.0 (85629)
