[Bug Summary]

- File Upload Filter Bypass Remote PHP Code Execution

- Open Redirection


[Impact]

- High


[Affected Version]

- N/A


[Bug Description and Proof of Concept]

- Jobscript suffers from an authenticated arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability is caused 
due to the improper verification of uploaded files in '/jobmoster/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' script thru the 'name' 
and 'file' POST parameters. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a malicious PHP script 
file with '.php' extension that will be stored in '/jobmoster/wp-content/uploads/jobmonster/' directory.

- Input passed via the 'redirect_to' POST parameter in '/jobmoster/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' is not properly verified 
before being used to redirect users. This can be exploited to redirect a user to an arbitrary website e.g. when a user 
clicks a specially crafted link to the affected script hosted on a trusted domain.
