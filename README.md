## Introduction
This repository serves as a centralized resource for security advisories, vulnerabilities, exploit code, and proof-of-concepts (PoCs). Each entry is assigned a unique identifier in the format `ZSL-YEAR-XXXX` (e.g., `ZSL-2008-4891`) and organized by year for easy navigation.

**Note:** This repository is for educational and research purposes only. Use the information responsibly and ethically.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized by year, with each year containing entries in the `ZSL-YEAR-XXXX` format. Each entry can be an advisory, exploit code, or PoC code. For example:

advisory/
├── 2008/
│ ├── ZSL-2008-4891/
│ ├── ZSL-2008-4892/
│ └── ...
├── 2009/
│ ├── ZSL-2009-4893/
│ ├── ZSL-2009-4894/
│ └── ...
├── 2010/
│ ├── ZSL-2010-4895/
│ ├── ZSL-2010-4896/
│ └── ...
└── ...


Each `ZSL-YEAR-XXXX` directory may contain:
- **Advisory Details**: A description of the vulnerability, including affected systems, CVSS scores, and mitigation strategies.
- **Exploit Code**: Functional code that exploits the vulnerability (if available).
- **PoC Code**: Proof-of-Concept code demonstrating the vulnerability.
- **References**: Links to external resources, such as CVE details, vendor advisories, or research papers.

## Advisory Format
Each entry is assigned a unique identifier in the format `ZSL-YEAR-XXXX`, where:
- `ZSL`: Stands for Zero Science Lab.
- `YEAR`: The year the entry was published.
- `XXXX`: A unique sequential number for the entry within that year, starting from **4891** and going up to **9999**.

Example: `ZSL-2008-4891` refers to the first entry published in 2008.
