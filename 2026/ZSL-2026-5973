eNet SMART HOME server 2.3.1 (deleteUserAccount) Arbitrary User Deletion


Vendor: Gira Giersiepen GmbH & Co. KG | ALBRECHT JUNG GmbH & Co. KG | Insta GmbH
Product web page: https://www.enet-smarthome.com
Affected version: 2.3.1 (46841)
                  2.2.1 (46056)

Summary: Two German specialists in building systems technology are jointly bringing
a new, wireless-based smart home system to the market. Gira and JUNG are the companies
behind the eNet SMART HOME brand with our subsidiary, INSTA, responsible for developing
the system. All three of us are old hands when it comes to building automation, and
have a history of connecting buildings in an intelligent way that goes back as far as
the 80s. Gira, JUNG and INSTA were part of the group of companies that initiated and
founded EIBA (now known as KNX). KNX is the first open global standard for home and
building automation. Through KNX, we have decisively shaped the development of intelligent
building systems technology – and this wealth of experience has now come together in
eNet SMART HOME. The eNet server is the heart of every eNet SMART HOME system and
offers end customers the basis for an easy-to-use and secure Smart Home and installation
engineers easily understandable and professional commissioning of the system.

Desc: The eNet Smart Home system contains an authorization weakness in the deleteUserAccount
JSON-RPC method that permits any authenticated low-privileged user (UG_USER) to delete
arbitrary user accounts, except for the built-in admin account. The application does not
enforce proper role-based access control on this function, allowing a standard user to
submit a crafted request specifying another username and have that account removed without
elevated permissions or additional confirmation. This enables unauthorized user management
actions, leading to denial of service against legitimate users, disruption of operations,
and potential concealment of malicious activity.

Tested on: GNU/Linux 4.4.15 (ARMv7 revision 5)
