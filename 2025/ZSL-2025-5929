Ksenia Security Lares 4.0 Home Automation PIN Logic Flaw


Vendor: Ksenia Security S.p.A.
Product web page: https://www.kseniasecurity.com
Affected version: Firmware version 1.6
                  Webserver version 1.0.0.15

Summary: Lares is a burglar alarm & home automation system that can
be controlled by means of an ergo LCD keyboard, as well as remotely
by telephone, and even via the Internet through a built-in WEB server.

Desc: The Ksenia home automation and burglar alarm system has a security
flaw where the PIN required to disable the alarm is exposed in the 'basisInfo'
XML file after initial authentication, allowing attackers who gain access
to this file to bypass security measures. This design flaw enables unauthorized
individuals to both disable the alarm system and manipulate smart home devices
by simply retrieving the PIN from the server response, effectively rendering
the security system useless since the supposedly secret PIN is easily obtainable
once an attacker reaches the authenticated state. The system should never expose
sensitive codes in API responses and should implement proper multi-factor
authentication for critical functions like alarm deactivation.

Tested on: Ksenia Lares Webserver
