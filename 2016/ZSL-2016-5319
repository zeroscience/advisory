ZeewaysCMS Multiple Vulnerabilities


Vendor: Zeeways
Product web page: http://www.zeewayscms.com
Affected version: unknown

Summary: ZeewaysCMS is a Content Management System and
a complete Web & Mobile Solution developed by Zeeways
for Corporates, Individuals or any kind of Business needs.

Desc: ZeewaysCMS suffers from a file inclusion vulnerability
(LFI) when encoded input passed thru the 'targeturl' GET parameter
is not properly verified before being used to include files.
This can be exploited to include files from local resources
with directory traversal attacks. Multiple cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities were also discovered. The issue is triggered
when input passed via multiple parameters is not properly
sanitized before being returned to the user. This can be
exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a
user's browser session in context of an affected site.

Tested on: Apache/2.2.27
           PHP/5.4.28
