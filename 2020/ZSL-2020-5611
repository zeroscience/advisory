Summary: Sony's BRAVIA Signage is an application to deliver
video and still images to Pro BRAVIAs and manage the information
via a network. Features include management of displays, power
schedule management, content playlists, scheduled delivery
management, content interrupt, and more. This cost-effective
digital signage management solution is ideal for presenting

and access the hidden '/#/content-creation' resource in the system.
