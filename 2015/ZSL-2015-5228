Realtek 11n Wireless LAN Utility Privilege Escalation


Vendor: Realtek Semiconductor Corp.
Product web page: http://www.realtek.com.tw
Affected version: 700.1631.106.2011

Summary: Realtek 11n Wireless LAN utility is deployed and used by realtek
alfa cards and more in order to help diagnose and view wireless card
properties.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the Realtek Service 'Realtek11nSU' and 'Realtek11nCU' for Windows deployed
as part of 11n USB Wireless LAN Utility. This could potentially allow an
authorized but non-privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with elevated
privileges on the system. A successful attempt would require the local user
to be able to insert their code in the system root path undetected by the
OS or other security applications where it could potentially be executed
during application startup or reboot. If successful, the local userâ€™s code
would execute with the elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7
