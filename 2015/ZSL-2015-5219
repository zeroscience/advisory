AdaptCMS 3.0.3 HTTP Referer Header Field Open Redirect Vulnerability


Vendor: Insane Visions
Product web page: http://www.adaptcms.com
Affected version: 3.0.3

Summary: AdaptCMS is a Content Management System trying
to be both simple and easy to use, as well as very agile
and extendable. Not only so we can easily create Plugins 
or additions, but so other developers can get involved.
Using CakePHP we are able to achieve this with a built-in
plugin system and MVC setup, allowing us to focus on the
details and end-users to focus on building their website
to look and feel great.

Desc: Input passed via the 'Referer' header field is not
properly verified before being used to redirect users.
This can be exploited to redirect a user to an arbitrary
website e.g. when a user clicks a specially crafted link
to the affected script hosted on a trusted domain.
