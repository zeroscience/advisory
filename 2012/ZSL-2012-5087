Vendor: Turnstyle
Product web page: http://www.turnstyle.com
Affected version: 1.9.3.6 PHP (2012)

Summary: Turn your MP3 collection into an MP3 server. Simply add a
single PHP or ASP script to any folder within your site. Now you
can browse and play the contents of that folder - over the Web, or
over your local network.

Desc: Andromeda is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

script.
