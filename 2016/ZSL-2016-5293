dbaudio R1 v2.14.4 DNS-SD Service Unquoted Service Path Privilege Escalation

Vendor: d&b audiotechnik GmbH
Product web page: http://www.dbaudio.com
Affected version: R1 2.14.4 and DNS-SD 379.32.2

Summary: The R1 Remote control software succeeds the d&b ROPE C software.
It is a software package designed to operate d&b amplifiers (D12, D6, E-PAC
with Display) remotely using the d&b Remote network based on CAN-Bus technology.

Desc: The application suffers from an unquoted search path issue impacting
the service 'dbaudio DNS-SD' for Windows deployed as part of dbaudio R1. This
could potentially allow an authorized but non-privileged local user to execute
arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the system. A successful attempt
would require the local user to be able to insert their code in the system
root path undetected by the OS or other security applications where it could
potentially be executed during application startup or reboot. If successful,
the local userâ€™s code would execute with the elevated privileges of the application.

Tested on: Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (EN)
           Microsoft Windows 7 Professional SP1 (EN)
