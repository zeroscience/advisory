SOCA Access Control System 180612 Reflected Cross-Site Scripting


Vendor: SOCA Technology Co., Ltd
Product web page: http://www.socatech.com
Affected version: 180612, 170000 and 141007

Summary: The company's products include proximity and fingerprint access
control system, time and attendance, electric locks, card reader and writer,
keyless entry system and other 30 specialized products. All products are
attractively designed with advanced technology in accordance with users'
safety and convenience which also fitted international standard.

Desc: The application suffers from a XSS issue due to a failure to properly
sanitize user-supplied input to the 'senddata' POST parameter in the 'logged_page.php'
script. Attackers can exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary HTML and
script code in a user's browser session.
