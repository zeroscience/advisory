Summary: VINCE is the Vulnerability Information and Coordination
Environment developed and used by the CERT Coordination Center
to improve coordinated vulnerability disclosure. VINCE is a
Python-based web platform.

Desc: The framework suffers from an authenticated stored
cross-site scripting vulnerability. Input passed to the
'content' POST parameter is not properly sanitised before
being returned to the user. This can be exploited to execute
arbitrary HTML/JS code in a user's browser session in context
of an affected site.
