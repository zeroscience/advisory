Vendor: iWT Ltd.
Product web page: http://www.iwt.com.hk
Affected version: Firmware 6.4.8 build 264 (Algorithm A16)
                  Firmware 5.7.2 build 568 (Algorithm A14)

Summary: FaceSentry 5AN is a revolutionary smart identity
management appliance that offers entry via biometric face
identification, contactless smart card, staff ID, or QR-code.
The QR-code upgrade allows you to share an eKey with guests
while you're away from your Office and monitor all activity
via the web administration tool. Powered by standard PoE
(Power over Ethernet), FaceSEntry 5AN can be installed in
minutes with only 6 screws. FaceSentry 5AN is a true enterprise
grade access control or time-and-attendance appliance.

Desc: FaceSentry is vulnerable to multiple cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities. This issue is due to the application's failure
to properly sanitize user-supplied input thru the 'msg' parameter
(GET) in pluginInstall.php script. An attacker may leverage any
of the cross-site scripting issues to have arbitrary script code
executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context
of the affected site. This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based
authentication credentials, phishing, as well as other attacks.
