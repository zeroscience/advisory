                  Hardware revision 1.1, 1.0

Summary: Flamingo XL, a new modular and high-density IPTV head-end
product for hospitality and corporate markets. Flamingo XL captures
live TV and radio content from satellite, cable, digital terrestrial
and analog sources before streaming it over IP networks to STBs, PCs
or other IP-connected devices. The Flamingo XL is based upon a modular
4U rack hardware platform that allows hospitality and corporate video
service providers to deliver a mix of channels from various sources
over internal IP networks.

Desc: The device uses a weak set of default and hard-coded administrative
credentials that can be easily guessed in remote password attacks and
gain full control of the system.

Tested on: GNU/Linux 3.14.29 (x86_64)
           Apache/2.2.22 (Debian)
           PHP/5.6.0
